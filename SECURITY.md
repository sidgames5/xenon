# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any part of Xenon OS, you must report it immediately. Absolutely DO NOT report security vulnerabilities as issues. This will inform the public about the details of the vulnerability and make it easier for hackers to exploit it. Instead please report vulnerabilities to the "Security" tab in this repository or directly contact a maintainer.
